        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create
        and structure web pages on the internet. It defines the basic layout of
        a webpage by using tags to organize content such as headings,
        paragraphs, images, links, and forms. HTML works as the foundation of
        web development and is commonly used along with CSS for styling and
        JavaScript for interactivity. Because of its simple syntax and easy
        learning curve, HTML is ideal for beginners and remains an essential
        technology for building modern, accessible websites.

        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to control the
        appearance and layout of web pages. It is used along with HTML to design
        webpages by applying styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, alignment,
        and responsiveness. CSS helps separate content from design, making
        websites easier to maintain and visually attractive. With features like
        flexbox, grid, and media queries, CSS enables developers to create
        modern, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces across different
        devices and screen sizes.

        JS (JavaScript) is a powerful scripting language used to add
        interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It allows developers to
        create features such as form validation, animations, dynamic content
        updates, and user interactions without reloading the page. JavaScript
        works alongside HTML and CSS to enhance the functionality and
        responsiveness of websites. Due to its wide browser support and
        versatility, JavaScript is an essential for building modern web
        applications and interactive user experiences.
